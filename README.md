This project is a classic Snake game developed using Core Java, with a focus on utilizing Swing, AWT, and Graphics for the user interface and game mechanics. The Snake game is a simple yet engaging project that showcases fundamental concepts of game development, including event handling, collision detection, and dynamic rendering.

Features:- 
Game Board Design: The game board is designed using Java Swing components, providing a clean and responsive interface for the player. The grid-based layout allows for precise snake movement and collision detection.

Snake Movement:- The snake's movement is controlled by the arrow keys, with smooth transitions between grid cells. The game logic ensures that the snake moves continuously in the last direction input by the player.

Food Generation:- Random food placement on the board encourages the player to navigate the snake towards the food to grow in length. The position of the food is recalculated each time it is consumed.

Collision Detection:- The game includes robust collision detection to determine when the snake runs into walls or itself, triggering the game-over state.

Score Tracking:- The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as the snake consumes food. The score is displayed on the game interface.

Game Over:- When the snake collides with the walls or its own body, the game ends, and a game-over message is displayed to the player.

Technologies Used

Java Swing: Used for creating the graphical user interface, including the game window, buttons, and score display.

Java AWT: Employed for handling low-level event processing, such as keyboard inputs and rendering graphics on the game board.

Graphics Class: Utilized for drawing the game components, including the snake, food, and game board.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The game is structured using OOP principles, making the code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

Abstract Classes & Interfaces: Abstract classes and interfaces are implemented to define the general structure of the game components and ensure consistency across different elements.

Exception Handling: Exception handling is employed to manage unexpected events and ensure the game runs smoothly without crashing.
